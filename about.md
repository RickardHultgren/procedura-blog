# About Procedura Blog

Welcome to the Procedura Blog, where we explore the intersection of domain expertise and process automation. I'm **Rickard Hultgren**, founder of Procedura, and this is where I share insights about Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the LYMPHA programming language, and the future of workflow management.

## What We Cover

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**
- Real-world SOP challenges across industries
- Best practices for procedure documentation
- Digital transformation of manual processes

**LYMPHA Language & Procedura Platform**
- Threshold-based decision making
- Parameter-centric procedure design  
- Behind-the-scenes development updates

**Industry Applications**
- Chemical safety and risk management (**KemSäker**)
- Quality control and manufacturing (**KvalKontroll**)
- General process management (**FlödeStyr**)

**Tool Integration & Reviews**
- Workflow automation platforms
- Quality management systems
- Documentation and collaboration tools

## The Mission

Traditional procedural guidelines are written as prose, flowcharts, or checklists. When domain experts need to make these procedures executable by computers, they must rely on programmers who often lack deep domain knowledge. This creates inefficiencies and knowledge gaps.

**Procedura solves this problem** by providing a platform where domain experts can create executable procedures using the LYMPHA language - bridging the gap between human expertise and automated decision-making.

## LYMPHA Language Key Features

- **Threshold-based decisions:** Replace traditional "if-then" statements with intuitive ranges and values
- **Parameter-centric structure:** Dynamic "spaghetti" code structure that suits procedural work better than linear programming
- **Concurrent processing:** Multiple related procedures can run simultaneously for complex workflows

## About Me

I'm a developer and entrepreneur based in Sweden, passionate about helping domain experts translate their knowledge into automated systems. With a background in both technical development and business process optimization, I founded Procedura to democratize process automation.
